This is an application dedicated to the huge SecretSanta in my Family, but i switched it to make a fullstack application.
You can pull this project as much as you want but be careful, the structure is yet to be optimized, there is no security, no clean code, no refactoring, just plain blank code that is yet to be optimized

## FAQ

#### Is there a monetary purpose on this application ?

No, i'm a fervent defender of the OpenSource programmation, eventually, if there's too much trafic and I need to update the machines architecture, there will be ads that will be solely used to it

#### What if the application is growing exponentialy ?

I highly doubt it, but if this happens, i'll probably cry in a corner to handle the massive trafic, just kidding, i'll probably ask desesperately for help from my fellow peers ! 

#### So, can i take it ?

Yup, but do not forget to credit my name !
