## FAQ

#### Is there a monetary purpose on this application ?

No, i'm a fervent defender of the OpenSource programmation, eventually, if there's too much trafic and I need to update the machines architecture, there will be ads that will be solely used to it

#### What if the application is growing exponentialy ?

I highly doubt it, but if this happens, i'll probably cry in a corner to handle the massive trafic, just kidding, i'll probably ask desesperately for help from my fellow peers ! 

#### So, can i take it ?

Yup, but do not forget to credit my name !
